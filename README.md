# Planet Generator

A Python project for procedurally generating images of foreign planets. The project uses various image processing and mathematical techniques to create realistic-looking planetary terrain maps.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features (Planned)
- 2D terrain map generation
- Height map visualization
- Procedural texture generation
- Atmospheric effects
- Surface features (craters, mountains, etc.)
